### 🎯 About Me

I'm passionate about learning how computers work from the ground up and exploring different areas of software engineering.

My goal is to become a Software Engineer and discover which field — systems, backend, or something else — suits me best.

Outside of coding, I enjoy working out, bouldering, and jogging 🧗‍♂️🏃‍♂️
